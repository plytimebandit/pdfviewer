The PDF Viewer can be used as a presenter for slides in PDF format, e.g. made in LaTeX.

When started the presentation is shown in fullscreen on one screen only.
You can navigate through slides using the arrow key, Enter or Space, by clicking any mouse button or using the mouse wheel.
You can exit the viewer by hitting the ESC-button.
